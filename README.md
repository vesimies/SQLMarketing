2. What is the user journey?
•	How many first touches is each campaign responsible for?
•	How many last touches is each campaign responsible for?
•	How many visitors make a purchase?
•	How many last touches on the purchase page is each campaign responsible for?

Start the following project, which will guide you through the queries you need to write with a series of questions. Make sure to save your queries and results — you’ll be using them in your presentation.
Then, create a set of slides using Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint, or some other presentation software. Your presentation should answer all of the questions in the project. Each answer should include a text explanation and data to support your claim. The queries used to find that data should be included in a separate .sql file.
